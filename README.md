# **🔗 Sigil-Vault – Secure URL Shortener**

## **📌 Project Overview**
**Sigil-Vault** is a **self-hosted Secure URL Shortener**, designed to provide a **lightweight, fast, and security-conscious** way to shorten URLs. It is built entirely with **HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP**. The project is **already live and functional** at:  

🔗 **[Live Demo: https://sglvt.com/](https://sglvt.com/)**  

This project was part of my **university studies in Cybersecurity**, specifically under the **Web Scripting course**, where I aim to **demonstrate secure and efficient web development practices**. The development process was supervised through **milestone-based meetings with my Web Scripting professor**, ensuring structured progress and adherence to best practices. 
When the project was completed it was recommended to the college's student excellency conference by the surpervising professor, and the conference's judging comittee accepted the project. 

While this was a **personal and academic project**, it is also an **opportunity to gain hands-on experience with GitHub, proper project structuring, scripting, security implementations, and UI/UX design**.
